## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core App Structure
1. **Navigation Setup**: Tab-based navigation with stack navigation
2. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with offline persistence
3. **Authentication**: Biometric + wallet integration
4. **Basic UI**: Mobile-optimized components

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **ZK-Proof Integration**: Mobile-optimized proof generation
2. **DID Management**: Decentralized identity mobile wallet
3. **Social Recovery**: Guardian management interface

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# React Native CLI
npm install -g react-native-cli

# iOS Development (macOS only)
sudo gem install cocoapods
cd ios && pod install

# Android Development
# Install Android Studio and configure SDK
```

### 2. Platform-Specific Code
```typescript
// Platform-specific implementations
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const BiometricAuth = Platform.select({
  ios: () => import('./ios/BiometricAuth'),
  android: () => import('./android/BiometricAuth'),
});
```

### 3. Testing Strategy
