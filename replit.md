# Replit.md - Coinsensus Decentralized Voting Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack decentralized voting platform called "Coinsensus" that enables secure, transparent, and blockchain-based voting campaigns. The application allows users to create and participate in voting campaigns with all votes recorded on the Polygon blockchain for complete transparency and immutability.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
